<h2>Hello </h2>
<p> Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal webpage. <br><br>
I am a Computer Science student in Effat university. This major has been of my interest in the last few years of my life. 
Learning computers science is really interesting yet challenging.
Also, I am very interested in learning about e-commerce and business. <br><br>
Aside from my education during free time, I like to practice 
my hobbies which include reading, drawing (digital and normal), and cooking.
 I joined a lot of courses to enhace my skills.
